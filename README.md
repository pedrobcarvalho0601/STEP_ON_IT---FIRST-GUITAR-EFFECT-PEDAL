# STEP_ON_IT â€” FIRST GUITAR EFFECT PEDAL

This was my first guitar pedal, built as a prototype for experimentation and testing.

It is a simple distortion pedal that uses a single BJT and asymmetric diode clipping, designed and laid out in KiCad.  
Before assembling the PCB, I first tested it on a breadboard until I achieved the sound I was looking for.
